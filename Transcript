00:00:13 Sarah Duister
OK.
00:00:16 Jasmijn Miog
Let's start.
00:00:17 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:00:18 Tessel Pluym
Let's start.
00:00:23 Tessel Pluym
So the point is to come to a design proposal based on the interview results, right?
00:00:29 Jasmijn Miog
Yes.
00:00:31 Tessel Pluym
So should we maybe?
00:00:34 Tessel Pluym
Discuss all the results from the interviews we did and then see what the.
00:00:39 Sarah Duister
Maybe we can like write down the key insights on the White Board.
00:00:45 Tessel Pluym
Oh yes good idea
00:00:46 Sarah Duister
And then.
00:00:46 Tessel Pluym
And then we can cluster them.
00:00:48 Sarah Duister
Cluster them.
00:00:53 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:00:56 Sarah Duister
Wait.
00:01:01 Tessel Pluym
Yes, or do we want to come..
00:01:02 Tessel Pluym
Up with.
00:01:04 Tessel Pluym
Oh, no, I think that's a good idea.
00:01:06 Tessel Pluym
Just do it based on that.
00:01:10 Sarah Duister
Or we had this like.
00:01:16 Sarah Duister
How did we call them?
00:01:18 Sarah Duister
User group.
00:01:19 Sarah Duister
Primary staircase, secondary and less obvious stakeholders.
00:01:25 Tessel Pluym
Yes.
00:01:26 Sarah Duister
Shall we make each one a different colour?
00:01:29 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
00:01:30 Sarah Duister
So primary.
00:01:32 Sarah Duister
Yes, like yellow and then secondary red.
00:01:36 Sarah Duister
I don't know
00:01:38 Tessel Pluym
And then blue.
00:01:41 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah.
00:01:43 Tessel Pluym
All right.
00:01:45 Tessel Pluym
And if we get started, we can add Joep’s after.
00:01:48 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, true. Yeah.
00:01:54 Jasmijn Miog
OK, now so the insights into the sticky notes.
00:01:59 Jasmijn Miog
Or do we just?
00:02:01 Jasmijn Miog
Want to talk about?
00:02:04 Jasmijn Miog
What we…
00:02:06 Jasmijn Miog
Whether we see in our into interviews.
00:02:10 Sarah Duister
Yeah. Yeah, we can.
00:02:12 Sarah Duister
Or.
00:02:14 Jasmijn Miog
And then directly cluster them.
00:02:15 Sarah Duister
Yeah. You like, like, yeah, maybe maybe like one person use the sticky note and the other people write it down. Yeah, yeah.
00:02:17 Tessel Pluym
Oh, so we can go through it together from the start. And then, yeah, I think that maybe it's a good idea.
00:02:27 Tessel Pluym
So we can just start at the top maybe.
00:02:31 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
00:02:33 Sarah Duister
Should I start?
00:02:34 Tessel Pluym
Yes.
00:02:34 Sarah Duister
Alright.
00:02:35 Sarah Duister
Are you writing it down then? OK.
00:02:37 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. Do we want to label them with their the target group they are?
00:02:42 Tessel Pluym
Like homeless people or we just want to?
00:02:43 Sarah Duister
Yeah, that's that might be nice.
00:02:47 Tessel Pluym
Maybe just in brackets or something?
00:02:51 Sarah Duister
So I.
00:02:54 Sarah Duister
Interviewed homeless people.
00:02:58 Sarah Duister
And he was.
00:03:02 Sarah Duister
He tells a lot of stories.
00:03:03 Sarah Duister
So very talkative.
00:03:08 Sarah Duister
Very emotional.
00:03:11 Sarah Duister
And he says, wait, I marked it.
00:03:15 Sarah Duister
He likes parks because they have trees and shadows and it's more peaceful than the street.
00:03:23 Sarah Duister
Because he can hide in certain spots and there's less trouble.
00:03:30 Sarah Duister
Nobody's chasing him there.
00:03:33 Jasmijn Miog
One moment, do we want all the insides of all these people in one sticky note or?
00:03:38 Tessel Pluym
No. Maybe we can like group it like the values or maybe the positive the negatives and then other.
00:03:48 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, that's a good idea.
00:03:50 Tessel Pluym
So we'll be out at this, I have positive's.
00:03:56 Sarah Duister
Yeah. Wait, you can also do maybe just.
00:03:58 Jasmijn Miog
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:04:08
Values.
00:04:10 Sarah Duister
Because there are more primary stakeholders.
00:04:14 Tessel Pluym
Oh yeah.
00:04:18 Tessel Pluym
Oh, so you can group it like that.
00:04:20 Sarah Duister
Yeah, you can put it underneath or something, yeah.
00:04:22 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, like this I got values.
00:04:28 Tessel Pluym
Negatives.
00:04:31 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:04:32 Sarah Duister
So I guess the values that I saw.
00:04:36 Sarah Duister
Safety.
00:04:41 Tessel Pluym
Or should values be like what he thinks is nice about the park?
00:04:48
Oh.
00:04:48 Tessel Pluym
So for example, like you said, like he's, he likes the trees and hidden spots so he can hide better.
00:04:53 Tessel Pluym
So that's.
00:04:53 Tessel Pluym
A positive for him in the park right now.
00:04:55 Jasmijn Miog
I think, yeah, that's a positive and I think the safety is a value, yeah.
00:04:58 Sarah Duister
Yeah, because behind that is safety.
00:05:01 Sarah Duister
Yeah. So maybe yeah.
00:05:04 Tessel Pluym
So maybe we need values and positives.
00:05:05 Sarah Duister
Yeah, I.
00:05:06 Sarah Duister
Yeah, I think we need that, yeah.
00:05:08 Sarah Duister
So this is more.
00:05:09 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, the values are behind positives and.
00:05:11 Sarah Duister
Yeah, true.
00:05:11 Jasmijn Miog
Negatives are.
00:05:13 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:05:13 Jasmijn Miog
The opposite.
00:05:15 Tessel Pluym
Of the values.
00:05:16 Tessel Pluym
Positives.
00:05:20 Sarah Duister
So he's searching for is he values peace and safety.
00:05:26 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:05:30 Sarah Duister
And yes, he his way of life is spending useful junk and maybe scratching it up or selling it.
00:05:41 Sarah Duister
So it's also like.
00:05:44 Sarah Duister
A park can be a resource because he can find stuff there.
00:05:56 Sarah Duister
And also a positive is nobody's chasing him in a park.
00:06:01 Tessel Pluym
Strange.
00:06:06 Jasmijn Miog
So he sees the park as a resource you said.
00:06:09 Sarah Duister
Yeah, because he can find stuff there to like repetch and resell.
00:06:13 Jasmijn Miog
Oh, OK.
00:06:16 Jasmijn Miog
So that's a positive I think.
00:06:17 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:06:25 Sarah Duister
Yeah, maybe like.
00:06:28 Sarah Duister
What he said that he keeps out of trouble from the cops because he can help out wherever he can.
00:06:39 Sarah Duister
And stand in. He helps out by cleaning up trash, helping with directions, or keeping an eye out.
00:06:46 Sarah Duister
Thought that was funny.
00:06:49 Sarah Duister
All right, that's a bit mean to say, but.
00:06:55 Sarah Duister
And he feels unsafe in a park because of people judging him. And because cops are always checking him.
00:07:07 Sarah Duister
So he's kind of monitored, monitored.
00:07:12 Tessel Pluym
So cops are checking on him and he feels judged.
00:07:16 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:07:20 Sarah Duister
Any thoughts?
00:07:24 Sarah Duister
Ways to improve safety are putting up more light poles and adding.
00:07:29 Sarah Duister
But like everyone of my stakeholders said that, so it's not really interesting. I think and he would like some more public restrooms because.
00:07:33 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, no.
00:07:40 Sarah Duister
Then you can use them.
00:07:43 Sarah Duister
Yeah, and.
00:07:46 Sarah Duister
He's just he goes to parks instead of like shelters or food banks because he feels a bit judged there and also he feels unsafe because.
00:07:55 Sarah Duister
People are a bit danger, can be a bit dangerous there.
00:07:59 Tessel Pluym
In the shelters. In shelters, yeah.
00:08:06 Sarah Duister
Very curious what you summarize from this
00:08:12 Jasmijn Miog
But he feel he feels unsafe.
00:08:12 Tessel Pluym
Wait, did he realize?
00:08:17 Jasmijn Miog
At the what was it?
00:08:21 Sarah Duister
Oh, it's a shelter. Sure, yeah.
00:08:22 Jasmijn Miog
And to Sheldon, is that like a negative because it's not in?
00:08:27 Jasmijn Miog
Park.
00:08:27 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. Or it's like a positive because in the park he does feel safe or safer, yeah.
00:08:31
Yeah.
00:08:33 Sarah Duister
But I think we already have that covered because he says I feel safe in the park because I can hide.
00:08:39 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, but when you say he feels judged like, did he realize in the interview that people may be scared of him?
00:08:45 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah.
00:08:47 Sarah Duister
That's why he feels judged, yeah.
00:08:49 Tessel Pluym
Should he put it down some?
00:08:50 Tessel Pluym
I think that could be a good insight as well. Maybe in the negatives or other, it's just like.
00:08:57 Sarah Duister
And.
00:09:00 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:09:04
Oh.
00:09:13 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:09:16 Sarah Duister
Yeah, we're.
00:09:17 Sarah Duister
I did interview with a youth or teenager who got associated with may feel labelled as unsafe or faced with themselves.
00:09:24 Jasmijn Miog
And that was a primary stakeholder
00:09:26 Sarah Duister
Primary.
00:09:29 Sarah Duister
So they go there.
00:09:31 Jasmijn Miog
How did you call those people?
00:09:33 Sarah Duister
Yeah, let's.
00:09:33 Jasmijn Miog
Oh, just teenagers.
00:09:34 Sarah Duister
Yeah. Let's just say you wanna, yeah.
00:09:35 Jasmijn Miog
Gathers.
00:09:42 Sarah Duister
OK, they go there because.
00:09:47 Sarah Duister
It's a chill place to hang out with friends without grown up stuff getting in the way.
00:09:53 Sarah Duister
There are less annoying rules and no teachers breathing down their neck or no parents.
00:10:00 Sarah Duister
Giving them chores.
00:10:07 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:10:12 Sarah Duister
There are people.
00:10:15 Sarah Duister
Folks are sometimes starting trouble because they see them as danger, like current types.
00:10:31 Sarah Duister
And he doesn't really understand why that happens.
00:10:40 Sarah Duister
You feel safe because there are people around and cops patrol the area.
00:10:48 Sarah Duister
And it's open.
00:10:50 Sarah Duister
You can see everywhere during the day.
00:10:54 Jasmijn Miog
I think open areas are a value right.
00:11:00 Sarah Duister
And.
00:11:03 Sarah Duister
Yeah. And I think also.
00:11:06 Sarah Duister
A value here is like an own space like it's kind of private.
00:11:12 Tessel Pluym
Oh yeah, there's no.
00:11:14 Tessel Pluym
There's no one. Oh, good one.
00:11:14 Sarah Duister
No. Yeah.
00:11:20 Sarah Duister
They are mostly not there when it's dark because it's harder to see and there are less people and it's more difficult to get help.
00:11:30 Jasmijn Miog
How do we call that?
00:11:32 Sarah Duister
I think privacy, yeah.
00:11:35 Tessel Pluym
OK so.
00:11:36 Sarah Duister
Or.
00:11:37 Sarah Duister
Actually freedom, they feel free there.
00:11:39 Tessel Pluym
I think so many other we can write down. They don't really go at night because it's dark.
00:11:44 Tessel Pluym
And there are less people around.
00:11:45 Sarah Duister
Yep.
00:11:50 Sarah Duister
Is there something more interesting there?
00:11:53 Sarah Duister
I don't really think so.
00:11:56 Sarah Duister
No.
00:12:01 Sarah Duister
And then the last one was.
00:12:04 Sarah Duister
Secondary stakeholder.
00:12:05 Sarah Duister
Wow. Beautiful cluster there.
00:12:43 Sarah Duister
And that was the police.
00:12:49 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, police.
00:12:50 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, also.
00:12:54 Jasmijn Miog
Primary stakeholder right.
00:12:56 Sarah Duister
Oh no, this is secondary.
00:12:57 Jasmijn Miog
Oh yeah. Secondary. Yeah.
00:13:00 Sarah Duister
All right, yeah.
00:13:06 Sarah Duister
They have most issues.
00:13:09 Sarah Duister
Concerning elderly people because.
00:13:13 Sarah Duister
They are.
00:13:14 Sarah Duister
They can't really defend themselves.
00:13:17 Tessel Pluym
Oh, should we?
00:13:18 Tessel Pluym
Also put this as positive negative and value in other.
00:13:21 Tessel Pluym
Maybe we should structure differently for this group.
00:13:24 Sarah Duister
Yeah, because they're not sure if there are a lot of values here.
00:13:30 Jasmijn Miog
I think.
00:13:31 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, I think the secondary stakeholders have values with there.
00:13:34 Sarah Duister
Yeah, they do, but.
00:13:36 Sarah Duister
But not really.
00:13:38 Sarah Duister
If it's concerning to park or more their role.
00:13:43 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, I think maybe based on their.
00:13:47 Jasmijn Miog
Their job or their attitude towards.
00:13:51 Jasmijn Miog
The situation.
00:13:51 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:13:53 Jasmijn Miog
So the police have, I think, values of safety also.
00:13:58 Jasmijn Miog
I think that's important for.
00:14:02 Sarah Duister
OK.
00:14:03 Sarah Duister
Yeah. So elderly people can defend themselves so.
00:14:09 Sarah Duister
They give most reports.
00:14:12 Sarah Duister
Most issues are verbal and physical conflicts.
00:14:20 Sarah Duister
Harassment, cat calling and drug dealing.
00:14:25 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:14:31 Jasmijn Miog
Drug dealing and?
00:14:34 Sarah Duister
Harassment kept calling.
00:14:38 Sarah Duister
And verbal and physical conflicts.
00:14:52 Sarah Duister
Yeah, what they do to keep security is regular patrols.
00:14:59 Sarah Duister
Security cameras and a community outreach program.
00:15:06 Tessel Pluym
Regular controls.
00:15:09 Sarah Duister
Yep, patrols, patrols, security cameras.
00:15:16 Sarah Duister
And community outreach program.
00:15:23 Sarah Duister
And I thought that last one was interesting because it learns teens to how to have responsible behaviour in public spaces and prevents antisocial behaviour.
00:15:36 Tessel Pluym
OK, A community out.
00:15:40
OK.
00:15:52 Tessel Pluym
And avoid what?
00:15:55 Sarah Duister
An antisocial behavior and I think he the policeman handle values empathy.
00:16:04 Sarah Duister
Because, for example, when he has trouble with homeless people, he tries to.
00:16:08 Sarah Duister
To handle it with empathy.
00:16:12 Sarah Duister
And also something I thought was interesting is, is not always about actual danger, but about perceptions.
00:16:20 Sarah Duister
So like elderly people seeing a homeless person.
00:16:25 Sarah Duister
They think.
00:16:27 Sarah Duister
Oh, he is danger.
00:16:29 Sarah Duister
Well, that's even not the case most of the times.
00:16:34 Jasmijn Miog
Did you encountered more values?
00:16:37 Jasmijn Miog
What police think is important and.
00:16:39 Sarah Duister
Yeah. A balance between protecting public safety and preserving personal freedom.
00:16:47 Tessel Pluym
That's a good value
00:16:47 Tessel Pluym
Maybe yeah.
00:16:50 Jasmijn Miog
Wait, what did you say?
00:16:51 Sarah Duister
A balance.
00:16:54 Sarah Duister
Between protecting public safety.
00:17:01 Sarah Duister
And preserving personal freedom.
00:17:09 Jasmijn Miog
Personal free?
00:17:11 Sarah Duister
Personal freedom.
00:17:14 Jasmijn Miog
Think I write to the preserving wrong
00:17:19 Sarah Duister
And the feeling of being watched can impact people's behavior in a negative way.
00:17:25 Tessel Pluym
Maybe also value right or negative?
00:17:25 Jasmijn Miog
Or negative.
00:17:27 Tessel Pluym
Oh yeah.
00:17:30 Tessel Pluym
So you're saying that too much patrolling would also?
00:17:33 Tessel Pluym
Not work, yeah.
00:17:42 Tessel Pluym
So that's all of yours? Yep.
00:17:55 Jasmijn Miog
OK, we can go over to.
00:17:58 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:17:59 Jasmijn Miog
Mine.
00:18:03 Jasmijn Miog
Where it is.
00:18:05 Jasmijn Miog
OK, I already get those to some insides and I start with the families for children.
00:18:15 Jasmijn Miog
They generally feel safe in the park.
00:18:21 Jasmijn Miog
But they like to keep an eye on the kids when they're in the park.
00:18:28 Jasmijn Miog
Umm.
00:18:30 Jasmijn Miog
She want to find the well lit areas and signs of security staff present to the park.
00:18:42 Sarah Duister
What? Wait, what did you say?
00:18:44 Jasmijn Miog
That she will find if she if she in the park, she will find the well lit areas and signs of security.
00:18:53
OK.
00:18:54 Tessel Pluym
Security.
00:18:57 Sarah Duister
Up.
00:19:00 Jasmijn Miog
However, there have been a safety concerns like witnessing loud behaviour, seeing and loitering near secluded areas. So she.
00:19:10 Sarah Duister
What does it mean?
00:19:12 Jasmijn Miog
She has she experienced loud behaviour.
00:19:17 Jasmijn Miog
And some.
00:19:19 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, I'm not safe. Safe situation.
00:19:25 Jasmijn Miog
So she is secure of their environment for their kids.
00:19:30
Yeah.
00:19:31 Jasmijn Miog
And she believes that the safety can be improved by structure rules about alcohol consumption and loud noise.
00:19:41 Jasmijn Miog
So that is her feeling.
00:19:45 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, she talks about.
00:19:47 Jasmijn Miog
The park infrastructure has impact on the security and.
00:19:54 Jasmijn Miog
Also, the well maintained pathways and facilities.
00:19:59 Sarah Duister
What the what?
00:20:01 Jasmijn Miog
The well maintained pathways and facilities.
00:20:07 Jasmijn Miog
And she feels safer when she avoids secluded areas and stick to well populated places.
00:20:19 Jasmijn Miog
And she also talked about the lightening in the security cameras that can improve the sense of security.
00:20:28 Tessel Pluym
Mm.
00:20:30 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, and she said that her public safety can be impacted by activities such as loitering.
00:20:39 Jasmijn Miog
Don't know what that mean.
00:20:41 Sarah Duister
Wait what.
00:20:42 Tessel Pluym
Loitering, loitering. Maybe that means, like, the like the hangjongeren. More like the people who are, like, just hanging around.
00:20:48 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, yeah.
00:20:49 Tessel Pluym
Suspicious.
00:20:51 Jasmijn Miog
And loud aggressive behaviour.
00:20:53 Jasmijn Miog
So that's for her and mean safety impacts and.
00:21:03 Jasmijn Miog
She really appreciate the peacefulness of the park and the secure environment when she visit the park.
00:21:12 Jasmijn Miog
She, like the wide pathways and well lit areas.
00:21:15 Sarah Duister
I don't know what pathways are.
00:21:18 Tessel Pluym
Pathways, pathways.
00:21:19 Sarah Duister
But oh pathways.
00:21:20 Sarah Duister
A pathways.
00:21:24 Sarah Duister
So she likes the peaceful.
00:21:31 Jasmijn Miog
And she said that that she goes to the park to spend time together and find tranquility.
00:21:39 Sarah Duister
Spend time together.
00:21:41 Jasmijn Miog
Has been going together.
00:21:44 Jasmijn Miog
It is for her space, for relaxation and family time, relaxation and family time.
00:21:55 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, but there are some safety concerns. As I said before, because the loud, loud behaviour, alcohol consumption, presidents of shady individuals.
00:22:07 Jasmijn Miog
That can impact.
00:22:10 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:22:10 Jasmijn Miog
And she said, I prioritize making areas more visible.
00:22:17 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, to determine unwanted behavior.
00:22:21 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:22:23 Jasmijn Miog
That was the family.
00:22:25 Jasmijn Miog
And I've the local community.
00:22:27 Sarah Duister
So is that a secondary?
00:22:34 Jasmijn Miog
No, the locals community is also primary.
00:22:38 Jasmijn Miog
So that is a guy that lives nearby the park.
00:22:47 Jasmijn Miog
OK, he.
00:22:51 Jasmijn Miog
Said that.
00:22:57 Jasmijn Miog
He's a frequent, frequent visitor of the park and he seen have seen the change and evolve over time and these changes have a positive impact because the safety improved.
00:23:12 Jasmijn Miog
And it made it more family friendly and enjoyable. 
00:23:24 Jasmijn Miog
He sees the bark as a second home because it's like his backyard because he lives near the park and he feels he's the feel of sense of ownership and connection.
00:23:39 Jasmijn Miog
And he.
00:23:45 Jasmijn Miog
Like to see more seating areas.
00:23:50 Jasmijn Miog
And.
00:23:52 Jasmijn Miog
More playground equipment so that the park will be more enjoyable for families.
00:23:58 Jasmijn Miog
You think that's very important and?
00:24:09 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, he also said about the.
00:24:13 Jasmijn Miog
The cameras.
00:24:16 Jasmijn Miog
In strategic locations can be helpful because.
00:24:18
Yeah.
00:24:20 Jasmijn Miog
Now it can improve the feeling.
00:24:24 Jasmijn Miog
Of safety.
00:24:25 Tessel Pluym
Maybe if all the stakeholders said that we should actually write it down, because then it could be a good conclusion, right? Yeah.
00:24:32
Yep.
00:24:35 Tessel Pluym
Because the homes people said.
00:24:37 Tessel Pluym
Said it as well, right?
00:24:39 Tessel Pluym
About the cameras.
00:24:40
Yeah.
00:24:42 Jasmijn Miog
And a dogs with him about the Fetty Falls that are in the park. And if he thinks it's annoying. But he really likes festivals.
00:24:53 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, because it's part of him in his backyard. But he thinks that.
00:25:01 Jasmijn Miog
The police and the security guards are important to make it safe also for him.
00:25:12 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:25:12 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, I've.
00:25:16 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
00:25:19 Jasmijn Miog
Look, if I missed something, but I think this is it, yeah.
00:25:25 Jasmijn Miog
OK. And then at the municipal authorities?
00:25:29 Jasmijn Miog
Is it where secondary?
00:25:30 Tessel Pluym
Secondary rights.
00:25:37 Jasmijn Miog
Great, she said that.
00:25:43 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, she works as a municipal authority and they are most frequently concerned about the entrances and exits of the park.
00:25:56 Jasmijn Miog
The parking.
00:25:58 Jasmijn Miog
And secluded parade.
00:26:02 Jasmijn Miog
That there are, yeah.
00:26:04 Jasmijn Miog
Those are more heavily.
00:26:07
Traffic.
00:26:11 Jasmijn Miog
And the late hours are more incident reporters than during.
00:26:17 Jasmijn Miog
The day.
00:26:19 Jasmijn Miog
So the late evening and early mornings.
00:26:24 Jasmijn Miog
The reports are mostly included vandalism, littering, noise, noise disturbances and theft.
00:26:34 Jasmijn Miog
Umm.
00:26:37 Jasmijn Miog
And issues are related to public intoxication, loitering and unauthorised gatherings.
00:26:49 Tessel Pluym
Loitering.
00:26:51 Jasmijn Miog
In altar eyes gatherings, all right.
00:26:54 Jasmijn Miog
That are most concerned to the park. Also in the early morning and in the late evening.
00:27:04 Jasmijn Miog
And if they implement safety measures, they includes.
00:27:12 Jasmijn Miog
Increased surveillance, patrolling and law enforcement agencies.
00:27:18 Jasmijn Miog
They improve the lightning and camera cameras.
00:27:25 Jasmijn Miog
Oh yeah, and they also established partnerships with local communities to promote safety awareness and engage residents in reporting any suspicious behaviour. While these measures have shown some effectiveness in reducing safety.
00:27:41 Jasmijn Miog
Incidents in the park.
00:27:42 Jasmijn Miog
It is possible that further improvements may be necessary.
00:27:45 Sarah Duister
Partnerships with local communities part.
00:27:48 Jasmijn Miog
It is to promote safety awareness and engage residents in reporting any suspicious behavior.
00:27:58
Morning.
00:28:03 Jasmijn Miog
So I.
00:28:06 Jasmijn Miog
Maybe we have to think about what their value is.
00:28:11 Jasmijn Miog
This stakeholder.
00:28:13 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, because probably their value would be.
00:28:15 Tessel Pluym
That's they, of course, want to have everyone feel safe.
00:28:18 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, unless.
00:28:19 Jasmijn Miog
Less reports, less reports.
00:28:21 Jasmijn Miog
They have less words.
00:28:22 Jasmijn Miog
To do.
00:28:23 Sarah Duister
The NFL is funny that they want to engage.
00:28:27 Sarah Duister
People in reporting suspicious behaviour. Doesn't that make people more aware of possible?
00:28:34 Jasmijn Miog
Dangers or at a local community.
00:28:34 Sarah Duister
Dangerous.
00:28:39 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, today it.
00:28:41 Jasmijn Miog
Will help the.
00:28:42 Jasmijn Miog
The people that live nearby park will also are kind of help.
00:28:49
Element.
00:28:52 Sarah Duister
Yeah, but.
00:28:54
Good.
00:28:55 Sarah Duister
Then they I think they do get more reports and people are very aware of the safety, so maybe they see more and therefore feel more unsafe I.
00:28:58 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, that's true.
00:29:07 Sarah Duister
Know just.
00:29:08 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, but it can also be, I think feel like.
00:29:12 Jasmijn Miog
We're doing this together and we're watching all together and because there's a community around.
00:29:20 Jasmijn Miog
The safety.
00:29:22 Jasmijn Miog
Maybe people will feel more safe because more people will.
00:29:24
Yeah.
00:29:26 Jasmijn Miog
Look for that.
00:29:28 Sarah Duister
That's.
00:29:29 Sarah Duister
Yeah, social, cultural is like.
00:29:33 Sarah Duister
People.
00:29:36 Sarah Duister
What are you saying?
00:29:38 Sarah Duister
Social control is seen as a way to increase perceived safety.
00:29:43 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, yeah.
00:29:47 Tessel Pluym
Yes, with.
00:29:48 Tessel Pluym
I get what you're saying that people would be my like, oh, so it's unsafe here.
00:29:48 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:29:51 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:29:51 Tessel Pluym
How they feel but also make them more alert maybe.
00:29:58 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:30:01 Tessel Pluym
So then we have ups.
00:30:05 Sarah Duister
Shouldn't we do yours first?
00:30:06 Tessel Pluym
Oh yeah, that's fine. So.
00:30:10 Tessel Pluym
This is this.
00:30:13 Sarah Duister
We can also do change.
00:30:18 Tessel Pluym
Thank you.
00:30:23 Sarah Duister
Yeah. OK.
00:30:26 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, we can do mine first.
00:30:30 Tessel Pluym
Let's see.
00:30:34 Tessel Pluym
So I have the joggers. I was.
00:30:37 Sarah Duister
Such a.
00:30:44 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:30:47 Tessel Pluym
They it's a joker. Who?
00:30:51
Oh.
00:30:54 Tessel Pluym
She wants to.
00:30:55 Tessel Pluym
She has a strong routine in her running, so she wants to go almost everyday, but she also has a job so she can only go on the morning or evening.
00:31:04 Tessel Pluym
And in the winter time, that's more difficult for her because it's dark often, and it makes her feel less safe.
00:31:17 Tessel Pluym
Usually she thinks.
00:31:18 Tessel Pluym
A safe place to go.
00:31:19 Tessel Pluym
Because there's a lot of people around.
00:31:24 Tessel Pluym
And her main concern is when it's very there's very little people in the park and.
00:31:29 Tessel Pluym
Very dark.
00:31:31 Tessel Pluym
Especially in the winter when it gets.
00:31:33 Tessel Pluym
So early.
00:31:38 Tessel Pluym
She doesn't feel safe because as a woman she is a female runner.
00:31:42 Tessel Pluym
It can be more dangerous because more people have bad intentions when there are less people around.
00:31:51 Tessel Pluym
When it's dark, she thinks it's quite you're quite vulnerable because it's difficult to see around you.
00:31:58 Tessel Pluym
So it's harder to be aware of any potential danger.
00:32:03
And.
00:32:06 Tessel Pluym
She feels safe is when she's surrounded by other people or other women.
00:32:17 Tessel Pluym
The changes she notices safety is that.
00:32:23 Tessel Pluym
That more people are having antisocial behavior.
00:32:26 Tessel Pluym
She had a scary experience with someone who purposely tried to trip her up.
00:32:32 Sarah Duister
Tripped her up? Doesn't mean.
00:32:33
Yeah.
00:32:36 Tessel Pluym
That follow.
00:32:38 Tessel Pluym
Oh.
00:32:40 Tessel Pluym
Ers her from going out when no one else is around because she's seen more people are with weird behavior.
00:32:50 Jasmijn Miog
How did you go?
00:32:51 Jasmijn Miog
Tileless.
00:32:52 Sarah Duister
Antisocial truth.
00:32:52 Tessel Pluym
Tripper up.
00:32:56 Tessel Pluym
And then the measure, measurements or improvements that would make her feel safer is add more lighting.
00:33:04 Tessel Pluym
Yeah as.
00:33:05 Tessel Pluym
There's plenty of space, and if there was more feasibility, she would feel safer.
00:33:11 Tessel Pluym
Also, more security patrolling in the dark.
00:33:18 Tessel Pluym
Mine was less talkative than yours, I think.
00:33:23 Sarah Duister
That's OK.
00:33:26 Tessel Pluym
Yes, I think the conclusions are she.
00:33:30 Tessel Pluym
Values visibility a lot and she wants to also when it's dark in the winter time early wants to be able to feel safe in the park.
00:33:37 Tessel Pluym
She likes going there because as a runner, there's not much traffic and visual streets.
00:33:42
Oh yeah.
00:33:43 Jasmijn Miog
So that's a value I think, yes, yeah.
00:33:48
And.
00:33:52 Jasmijn Miog
How do you call this value?
00:33:55 Sarah Duister
Also, freedom.
00:33:57 Tessel Pluym
Good place for running or.
00:34:00 Sarah Duister
I don't really feel you.
00:34:04 Jasmijn Miog
Lesser no air traffic air traffic.
00:34:08 Sarah Duister
How do you say like it's easy?
00:34:10 Jasmijn Miog
To move around. Yeah, freedom, I think is good.
00:34:13
Yeah.
00:34:15 Tessel Pluym
Freedom of movement, yeah.
00:34:16 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:34:19 Tessel Pluym
Fewer obstacles to something.
00:34:19 Jasmijn Miog
For this.
00:34:29 Sarah Duister
Which one did?
00:34:30 Sarah Duister
Have for.
00:34:30 Tessel Pluym
OK. And then I have the urban planner.
00:34:32 Tessel Pluym
Let's say less obvious stakeholders.
00:34:34
OK.
00:34:38 Tessel Pluym
So I I asked him a bit of different.
00:34:40 Tessel Pluym
So maybe this doesn't really work with the format of the benefits and values, but we can try.
00:34:43 Sarah Duister
OK, OK.
00:34:48 Tessel Pluym
So he thinks.
00:34:52 Tessel Pluym
The the the areas of a park that contribute to safety concerns are poorly lit areas, of course.
00:34:58 Tessel Pluym
Dark corners, or pathways that are not well lit, create opportunities for crimes. Like theft and assault.
00:35:06 Sarah Duister
I I hear 2 times lightning now, right?
00:35:10 Tessel Pluym
Yes.
00:35:12 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:35:13 Tessel Pluym
It's sort of the same with this one that also works with the blind spots, so areas where the visibility is limited, like between buildings and finding dark spots between the trees. Which make it difficult to monitor and prevent criminal activity. And then he says as another safety concern, or that can be a safety concern, it's overly complicated layouts. So parks that have complex pathways and confusing layouts can make it difficult for people to navigate the area. The design features in a park that unintentionally hinder safety could be poorly designed. So for example, pathways that are poorly lit or poorly maintained, or obstacles like plants and or poor drainage can be hazardous or uncomfortable for users, so that's not so much about crimes, but more like falling.
00:36:15 Sarah Duister
Yeah. Poor what? I only have poor now.
00:36:19 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, poor drainage. So also poorly lit, poorly maintained or overgrown plants.
00:36:25 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:36:26 Tessel Pluym
OK. And then it all he also mentioned the lack of safety equipments like emergency phones, call boxes and security cameras. Based on his experience with similar park projects. The design interventions that have been most successful have been increasing natural supervision, so positioning. 
00:36:54 Sarah Duister
Wait, wait. What does increasing natural supervision doesn't.
00:36:56 Tessel Pluym
It means positioning features in ways that create natural lines of sight, allowing more people to see and watch the area. It also says improving lighting again and then he says, minimizing hiding spots. So that's (hidden spots) what the homeless person was looking for, but the urban planner describes reducing the number of hidden spots such as overgrown plants or secluded areas.
00:37:18 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:37:24 Tessel Pluym
Which make it more difficult for potential criminals.
00:37:29 Jasmijn Miog
What do you think that the values of the urban planners are?
00:37:35 Tessel Pluym
I think, oh, I think it's coming now.
00:37:38 Sarah Duister
Oh.
00:37:38 Tessel Pluym
So I asked. How can we increase safety improvements while still maintaining the park's natural aesthetic and ecological value? So that's a value he wants, to balance safety improvements while still having a natural aesthetic and ecological value.
00:38:01 Tessel Pluym
Some strategies that can be used to achieve this balance is minimally invasive design which is design features that blend in with the natural environment.
00:38:13 Tessel Pluym
So like if you have safety interventions, they blend in with the aesthetic of the park. And preservation minded design. Integrating safety features without disrupting the ecosystem and causing damage to local fauna and flora.
00:38:34 Sarah Duister
Preservation design minded?
00:38:36 Tessel Pluym
Conservation minded design.
00:38:39 Sarah Duister
And how did you call that? 
00:38:41 Tessel Pluym
Integrating safety features without disrupting the ecosystem.
00:38:46 Sarah Duister
OK.
00:38:52 Tessel Pluym
The challenges he sees in enhancing the safety are: resistance to change.
00:38:58 Tessel Pluym
Well, I don't think that's very relevant. But also: budget constraints and lack of maintenance.
00:39:14 Tessel Pluym
And then I discussed with him the overlooked user groups that should be considered in the parks redesign to ensure inclusivity, safety, and he mentioned people with disabilities, so making sure all the pathways are well maintained. So they can have wheelchairs around.
00:39:35 Tessel Pluym
Also for immigrants and refugees so the park can become a place for cultural exchange and social integration.
00:39:45 Tessel Pluym
Also people experiencing homelessness, homeless people may use parks as a place to rest and find refuge.
00:39:53 Tessel Pluym
Oh.
00:39:56 Tessel Pluym
My sentence is cut off.
00:39:57 Tessel Pluym
But then he mentions installing safety measures such as camera security cameras and emergency equipment.
00:40:04 Sarah Duister
OK.
00:40:09 Tessel Pluym
Well, so that was it for the urban planner.
00:40:13 Tessel Pluym
00:40:19 Tessel Pluym
So we can just move on to the.
00:40:23 Jasmijn Miog
Elderly visitors.
00:40:27 Sarah Duister
Primary.
00:40:32 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, primary.
00:40:35 Jasmijn Miog
He had the experience where he enjoyed the greenery and fresh air. They feel connected to nature, is their value.
00:40:52 Jasmijn Miog
They're worried about tripping or uneven paths to walk on.
00:41:11 Jasmijn Miog
It is their routine to walk in the mornings, and I sometimes meet friends or neighbours.
00:41:22 Jasmijn Miog
They like to sit on a bench watching birds or people pass by. They go for the nature, exercise and relaxation. They feel relatively safe during the day. Especially when other visitors are around.
00:41:40 Jasmijn Miog
But early mornings and late afternoons, when the crowd slims out, they may feel a little uneasy. The secluded areas in insufficient lighting make them nervous.
00:41:57 Jasmijn Miog
I also noticed occasional litter or sides of vandalism, which are just neglected and make me question whether it's being monitored properly.
00:42:10 Jasmijn Miog
Vandalism is also related to the monitoring, I think.
00:42:21 Jasmijn Miog
They feel safe during their visit in the central areas, the open spaces, the park entrances. When they have people around. Especially with families and joggers nearby they create a sense of community and security.
00:42:47 Jasmijn Miog
They feel least unsafe at the edges of the park or secluded pathways. The places that are more isolated.
00:43:03 Jasmijn Miog
It is easy to imagine something going wrong there. The lack of visibility and potential for someone to approach unnoticed make me feel exposed.
00:43:15 Jasmijn Miog
Sometimes I hear about incidents on the news which amplify this fear. In the recent years, I've seen fewer park staff patrolling in the area. Some paths and benches are in poor condition. The lights seems dimmer than it used to be.
00:43:37 Jasmijn Miog
Better maintenance in parts and benches would help. Adding more lighting and having security personnel or volunteers visible would make me feel much safer.
00:43:49 Jasmijn Miog
That is it.
00:43:54 Jasmijn Miog
Then we have the tourists.That's also primary user group.
00:44:05 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:44:07 Jasmijn Miog
They think the parks are visually, visually stunning and feel like little escapes from the city. They feel unsure about areas. About which areas are safe because they're unfamiliar with the layout.
00:44:29 Jasmijn Miog
OK, then when I visited Rotterdam. I make it a point to check out at least one park. They offer great way to relax and explore the local culture, always from the usual tourist spots.
00:44:44 Jasmijn Miog
They like to take photos. And feel the atmosphere and they see it as a glimpse into the everyday lives of the locals. They value that as traveller. So it's a good value, they feel during the day, comfortable.
00:45:03 Sarah Duister
Wait, sorry.
00:45:05 Tessel Pluym
I got it.
00:45:05 Sarah Duister
This one OK. And you said something about value?
00:45:09 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, that's the glimpse into the everyday life of local is a value, yeah.
00:45:16 Jasmijn Miog
They feel uncomfortable in the evening. It's quieter, more quiet, and they do feel a bit uneasy. Also the lack of people and unclear signs make them feel disoriented and concerned about being in the wrong place at the wrong time, not knowing the local reputation or certain areas.
00:45:43 Jasmijn Miog
They feel safe in open areas. Close to the main entrance. Where there are families and groups.
00:45:58 Jasmijn Miog
They like places with clear signs.
00:46:06 Jasmijn Miog
And they're shown around in the well-maintained and monitored space.
00:46:30 Jasmijn Miog
And then. Yeah, I think they think more maps and signs will help.
00:46:40 Jasmijn Miog
OK. And then the last one is women.
00:46:46 Jasmijn Miog
Also primary.
00:46:46 Tessel Pluym
Alright, yes.
00:46:56 Jasmijn Miog
OK.
00:46:58 Jasmijn Miog
They feel serene and calm in the mornings, but after sunset they are constantly looking over their shoulder and rushing to get out.
00:47:09 Jasmijn Miog
They are going there for jogging or a peaceful moments for themselves before or after work.
00:47:18 Jasmijn Miog
Convenient and pleasant way to exercise or reflect without distraction.
00:47:22 Sarah Duister
Hmm, that's a value I think.
00:47:24 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
00:47:26 Tessel Pluym
Exercise without distraction.
00:47:27 Sarah Duister
Yeah. And meditate, right.
00:47:31 Tessel Pluym
Relax, relax. Relax, relax.
00:47:31 Sarah Duister
Perfect.
00:47:36 Jasmijn Miog
And a natural environment is refreshing.
00:47:39 Jasmijn Miog
So they value the refreshment.
00:47:39 Tessel Pluym
That's a sort of value, right? Refreshing.
00:47:47 Jasmijn Miog
OK. On some paths they feel completely abandoned. Lacking lighting. Means that makes me feel exposed.
00:47:59 Jasmijn Miog
I also hear occasional stories about harassment, which always stays in the back of my mind.
00:48:10 Jasmijn Miog
She likes the presence of other people in the natural lights.
00:48:21 Jasmijn Miog
The isolation of being in the dark areas will lead to less safety combined with poor visibility.
00:48:34 Jasmijn Miog
There are feeling vulnerable. Yeah. And then the same about she thinks about the physical cameras will help.
00:48:53 Jasmijn Miog
And small patrols or volunteers present make a big difference. That's it.
00:49:00 Tessel Pluym
All right. OK.
00:49:02 Tessel Pluym
Should we now try to cluster these into like main themes?
00:49:05 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:49:06 Tessel Pluym
Maybe we should, since we're working towards the design proposal, we should look at cluster bases on the feeling it gives them.

00:49:14 Tessel Pluym
Like what makes them feel safe and what do they think would be the good intervention, right?
00:49:19 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
00:49:19 Tessel Pluym
So those would be 3 clusters and then we have a category: other.
00:49:23 Jasmijn Miog
I also think that it's nice to think about some people like the homeless people were looking for the dark spots and more benches.
00:49:34 Sarah Duister
Like kind of the tensions.
00:49:34 Tessel Pluym
But, yeah, maybe. Oh yeah.
00:49:35 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, the tensions.
00:49:37 Sarah Duister
Between the groups.
00:49:39 Jasmijn Miog
The tensions and then?
00:49:42 Jasmijn Miog
What will help for all of them?
00:49:44 Sarah Duister
Yeah, I like this together. Let's do this.
00:49:49 Sarah Duister
So we have one row with tensions.
00:49:58 Jasmijn Miog
Because the proposal is great. We also have to think about how to tackle perceptions of safety.
00:50:13 Sarah Duister
Yeah. Like that perceptions workshop and inclusive design.
00:50:52 Sarah Duister
Yeah, tensions that stood out to me were. The ones that we discussed earlier, the perceived safety, but also at the same time social control.
00:51:08 Tessel Pluym
Oh yeah, so if you have everyone like encouraged to lookout for suspicious behaviour.
00:51:19 Tessel Pluym
It also makes them feel like there would be suspicious behaviour.
00:51:19 Sarah Duister
Yeah, because I  heard in multiple interviews people saying when I hear of incidents that stays in my mind. Yeah.
00:51:30 Sarah Duister
So.
00:51:30 Tessel Pluym
Oh, that's a good tension, I think.
00:51:33 Sarah Duister
Umm.
00:51:35 Sarah Duister
But social change was not with social control. Yes, and.
00:51:41 Sarah Duister
Perceived safety was something else. Something like this, yeah.
00:51:46 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah. And I think before the proposal we have to frame a problem.
00:51:50 Sarah Duister
OK. Yeah.
00:51:51 Jasmijn Miog
But I think we can make the proposal out of the tensions.
00:51:56 Sarah Duister
Yeah, I think so too, yeah.
00:52:10 Sarah Duister
And another one I heard was the one where the policeman talks about balance between protecting public safety and preserving personal freedom.
00:52:34 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. So if you have a lot of patrol, it's will also feel like people are being monitored.
00:52:43 Sarah Duister
So protecting public safety versus preserving personal freedom.
00:53:08 Sarah Duister
Sure thing.
00:53:14 Sarah Duister
Yeah, that's one I also think, yeah.
00:53:21 Tessel Pluym
OK.
00:53:23 Sarah Duister
Did you see more?
00:53:42 Sarah Duister
Also, there is one that the cop says about protecting safety versus preserving personal freedom that also aligns with what the youth said that the park feels like a free space.
00:53:54 Sarah Duister
No adult is kind of breathing in their necks.
00:53:57 Sarah Duister
Yeah. So that kind of goes away if there are more rules or more cameras and more patrols.
00:54:02 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
00:54:05 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah. And maybe.
00:54:09 Jasmijn Miog
The urban Planner talks about the aesthetic appearance.
00:54:14 Jasmijn Miog
There are more monitored areas.
00:54:17 Tessel Pluym
Oh yeah, it could be a tension as well.
00:54:20 Tessel Pluym
Where the preservation of the natural aesthetic and the ecosystem versus like camera control and things like that, because it's sort of like keep putting electricity in the air.
00:54:29 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, yeah. 
00:54:32 Sarah Duister
And so maybe nature versus technology something.
00:54:37 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
00:54:38 Sarah Duister
That, yeah.
00:54:50 Jasmijn Miog
Because it's the question if in your proposal you if you want to get the homeless people out of your park.
00:54:59 Jasmijn Miog
Then it's the homeless people in your city, and if you het them out of your park, they go somewhere else.
00:55:11 Jasmijn Miog
Yes. So they go away. Or you can have them in your park in a good way.
00:55:16 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, but I think realistically people usually feel scared when there's homeless people around, so it's going to be hard to be able to include the homeless people.
00:55:25 Sarah Duister
Yeah. Or they are part of the volunteers who patrol for security.
00:55:32 Sarah Duister
Like that.
00:55:33 Sarah Duister
And they in return get something for it maybe.
00:55:38 Sarah Duister
Somewhere in the park, a space for them.
00:55:40 Tessel Pluym
Oh, that could be a good idea.
00:55:44 Tessel Pluym
So that they actively participate, yeah.
00:55:50 Sarah Duister
Most of them don't really have anything to do. OK.
00:55:55 Tessel Pluym
OK, so I think these are good tensions.
00:55:57 Tessel Pluym
This could help us.
00:56:02 Tessel Pluym
Should we then try to see what the general consensus are around feeling safe and feeling unsafe.
00:56:09 Tessel Pluym
I think it's quite clear themes throughout everything.
00:56:10 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:56:14 Tessel Pluym
Where most people just want to be surrounded, they feel safe during the day, and when they're surrounded by other people.
00:56:20 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:56:32 Jasmijn Miog
And maybe there's also a tension between tourists because the tourists talked about clear signs and they don’t know. They don't know where they are and how to navigate in the park like this and maybe. The elderly or yeah, other people think that's weird behaviour.
00:57:02 Tessel Pluym
What is?
00:57:02 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, I'm guessing tourists are bit lost in the park and they want more signs and things.
00:57:13 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, maybe.
00:57:13 Jasmijn Miog
00:57:17 Sarah Duister
Yeah, maybe.
00:57:20 Sarah Duister
A lot of people see it as an escape from daily life, so they kind of don't want to explore, I think because.
00:57:30 Tessel Pluym
Oh, that can be a good tension as well, yeah.
00:57:34 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, indeed.
00:57:35 Sarah Duister
So escape versus exploring something like that, yeah.
00:58:02 Sarah Duister
I also think a consensus is the park helps the people to feel at peace and to connect with nature.
00:58:14 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. So sort of similar to the first one with the monitoring, if there's police everywhere, it could disturb sort of the peace.
00:58:23 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah, true.
00:58:25 Tessel Pluym
I think these are like good ones either way, because when we're going to think about the design proposal, we need to keep it in mind.
00:58:32 Sarah Duister
Yeah, I like the tensions.
00:58:35 Sarah Duister
I think should we like, choose one that we're gonna work with.
00:58:42 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. So are we gonna find one design proposal together? Yeah. OK.
00:58:47 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah.
00:58:54 Jasmijn Miog
Oh yeah.
00:58:57 Jasmijn Miog
This is a brief enough to encapsulate a problem, but complex enough to explore different directions.
00:59:07 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
00:59:25 Sarah Duister
Yeah. Maybe also general one. Should I make one with general insights on what the park means to people?
00:59:31 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. Yeah, because it's the values.
00:59:34 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:59:35 Sarah Duister
Fair use of the park, yeah.
00:59:42 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, I think we can describe the problem out of of those tensions, how we see the problem, but maybe work out one each.
00:59:49 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
00:59:55 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah, because the problem is the tensions, right?
00:59:59 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:00:00 Sarah Duister
OK.
01:00:00 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, that's why it's not working for all groups together.
01:00:11 Sarah Duister
These kind of parks are kind of an escape for people as well, right?
01:00:18
Yeah.
01:00:19
Escape.
01:00:26 Sarah Duister
And is there something else?
01:00:32 Tessel Pluym
So if we consider the tensions and the things that make people feel safe and not feel safe.
01:00:45 Sarah Duister
And the general values of a park.
01:00:51 Sarah Duister
Yeah, let’s maybe just put out some ideas, yeah.
01:00:58 Tessel Pluym
I think so.
01:00:59 Tessel Pluym
I thinkt it could be good to focus on the feasibility though.
01:01:05 Tessel Pluym
It can be hard for the homeless people.
01:01:07 Tessel Pluym
But I feel like that would be some of the more general things that people, if people feel like they are hidden, like if they're walking between the trees, that's something can easily happen to them. Well, open spaces always attracts more attention, even if something happens.
01:01:22 Sarah Duister
Yeah, but then you do need to watch out for the like not monitoring too much because then that affects perceived safety or the personal freedom goes away. And I think freedom is also an important value of the park for many people.
01:01:40 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, I agree.
01:01:42 Tessel Pluym
And also during the day, people want to walk in the woods, but at night they don't.
01:01:45 Jasmijn Miog
Feel safe because if you think about what's the goal of a park, why do the urban planners place a park in city?
01:01:45 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:01:52 Jasmijn Miog
I think for relaxing and distraction.
01:01:55 Jasmijn Miog
So I think that's the main goal, yeah.
01:02:00 Jasmijn Miog
But that's it is also for homeless people a relaxation place.
01:02:03 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:02:05 Jasmijn Miog
That's where the tensions are.
01:02:07 Tessel Pluym
But I think the homeless people are also a big bottleneck in the problems of the park.
01:02:12 Sarah Duister
But also the youth. Yeah.
01:02:20 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. So there should be like rules about like alcohol consumption and things so that they don't go to the park just to do that there.
01:02:29 Sarah Duister
I don't know if that is the solution?
01:02:32 Sarah Duister
More rules and open spaces, I think that it is almost too obvious or something.
01:02:39 Tessel Pluym
Yeah.
01:02:40 Sarah Duister
That's because then the youth or the homeless people go somewhere else and another problem is created.
01:02:46 Jasmijn Miog
It has another bad effect.
01:02:48 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:02:51 Jasmijn Miog
But we can start with defining a problem. 
01:02:57 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, but we have interviewed so many different people.
01:02:59 Tessel Pluym
Just different problems also for different people.
01:03:02 Sarah Duister
Yeah, but like I said earlier. Like.
01:03:11 Sarah Duister
Actually. How do you say?
01:03:15 Sarah Duister
Getting youth and homeless people in and, like, make them actively participate to preserve safety.
01:03:24 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, especially I think youth can be too rebellious to want to participate.
01:03:29 Tessel Pluym
But I think homeless people, that's could work. Where you, like, reward them with anything. Yeah, like either food or drinks or something.
01:03:40 Jasmijn Miog
Then the problem is. Or then the aim of the park is.
01:03:59 Jasmijn Miog
So maybe it's the problem that the goals of being in the park is stakeholder…
01:04:03 Tessel Pluym
Stakeholder misalignments.
01:04:07 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
01:04:07 Sarah Duister
Beautiful design word.
01:04:10 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, that there's a misalignment of visitors and that can not work together. So that's.
01:04:16 Tessel Pluym
True.
01:04:17 Tessel Pluym
Because also I think if you have. The people involved, you know, like the homeless people at the bench when you bike here.
01:04:23 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
01:04:25 Tessel Pluym
Everyone almost knows them and are like familiar with them, so they're never scary anymore because everyone's just familiar with them.
01:04:30 Sarah Duister
They are even called the motivational bench.
01:04:32 Sarah Duister
Exactly so.
01:04:35 Tessel Pluym
Maybe people get used to like the homeless people and the homeless people are trained to present themselves in a certain way so they're not like screaming and running around.
01:04:37 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:04:43 Sarah Duister
Yeah. And then also, yeah, because they also think a lot of safety.
01:04:50 Sarah Duister
The perceived safety also goes up.
01:04:54 Sarah Duister
If those groups are perceived as more normal or yeah more safe.
01:05:02 Jasmijn Miog
You have to influence their behavior, I think.
01:05:07 Sarah Duister
But also influence how they are.
01:05:09 Jasmijn Miog
Perceived. Yeah. Yeah, because the.
01:05:14 Jasmijn Miog
The homeless people at the bench, they are making fire and having having a lot of, yeah.
01:05:19 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, I think they're a very good.
01:05:21 Tessel Pluym
Of like the.
01:05:23 Tessel Pluym
Even if you're scared and you're walking on the street and then you see them on the bench, you'll be like, OK.
01:05:27 Tessel Pluym
There's people you can like instead of being scared of them, you feel you'd feel almost safer if you see them because you're just.
01:05:29 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
01:05:33 Sarah Duister
Because they're always there.
01:05:34 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, and they never.
01:05:36 Sarah Duister
They never really do anything. They just hang out, yeah.
01:05:37 Tessel Pluym
No, they just say good luck.
01:05:40 Jasmijn Miog
You have to think about, for example, the tourists that are not familiar in the park.
01:05:48 Jasmijn Miog
How can we ensure that they're also feeling safe by those people?
01:05:54 Tessel Pluym
Sometimes when you're like designing with inclusive design, I just think I don't care about the tourist there.
01:06:01 Sarah Duister
Yeah, it's up there.
01:06:02 Tessel Pluym
I just stay out.
01:06:02 Tessel Pluym
The park, if you don't feel safe.
01:06:04 Sarah Duister
And there's also just there, so irregular.
01:06:07 Tessel Pluym
But you can hear it as.
01:06:11 Sarah Duister
All.
01:06:11 Sarah Duister
Better than the defined problem is kind of.
01:06:16 Sarah Duister
I feel like we kind of.
01:06:21 Sarah Duister
Choosing the social control versus perceived safety. Tension, yeah.
01:06:28 Sarah Duister
How should we define it?
01:06:29 Jasmijn Miog
I think that's the main main tension.
01:06:32 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:06:36 Jasmijn Miog
Low version, didn't you?
01:06:40 Sarah Duister
How do you?
01:06:41 Sarah Duister
How can you write it down in a sentence?
01:06:47 Jasmijn Miog
There is.
01:06:50 Jasmijn Miog
Misalignments.
01:06:53 Jasmijn Miog
In social, there's a mission is misalignment between all stakeholders.
01:07:02
Sister.
01:07:07 Sarah Duister
Maybe.
01:07:09 Tessel Pluym
The need for the need for the monitoring to feel safe.
01:07:14 Tessel Pluym
Is.
01:07:16 Tessel Pluym
Is contradictory with the desire for the freedom.
01:07:22
Hmm.
01:07:24 Jasmijn Miog
We can ask our friend.
01:07:31 Tessel Pluym
Maybe we should.
01:07:32 Tessel Pluym
Ask for friends.
01:07:35 Sarah Duister
I think.
01:07:38 Sarah Duister
The.
01:07:40 Sarah Duister
So who are perceived as unsafe?
01:07:45 Sarah Duister
Don't per say have bad attentions.
01:07:48 Sarah Duister
So maybe the problem is that's the perceived dangers.
01:07:55
Repl.
01:07:55 Sarah Duister
Are not actually dangerous.
01:07:57 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. In a way, that's I.
01:07:59 Tessel Pluym
That's true, but also.
01:08:02 Tessel Pluym
In some situations, maybe like they are because we didn't talk to the youth and the homeless people who actually do do the crimes.
01:08:05 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:08:09 Sarah Duister
Do. Yeah. Uh, dangers do not have to be, no.
01:08:19 Tessel Pluym
OK, my friend is saying.
01:08:21 Tessel Pluym
Well, increased policing enhances safety for some users. It can create discomfort and exclusion for others who value privacy and freedom.
01:08:31 Jasmijn Miog
There's a difference. I will ask my friend to.
01:08:35 Sarah Duister
You didn't have to be dangerous.
01:09:14 Sarah Duister
Announcing of safety for so.
01:09:17 Sarah Duister
For some, it can oscillate a feeling.
01:09:24 Jasmijn Miog
My friend said fate.
01:09:27 Jasmijn Miog
The park struggles to balance safety and security with personal freedom, inclusivity and ecological preservations.
01:09:36 Sarah Duister
How does the ecological preservation come from?
01:09:40 Tessel Pluym
And that's part of the value of the net.
01:09:42 Tessel Pluym
Natural.
01:09:44 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
01:09:44 Sarah Duister
You put in all the tensions.
01:09:47 Jasmijn Miog
I make there one problem statement. Measures to enhance safety can infringe on freedom or disrupt the environment while unregulated access can leave some users feeling unsafe. These tensions challenge the park's ability to be a safe, welcoming and sustainable space for all.
01:10:06 Sarah Duister
I think that's very long as in I, I can't really work with it.
01:10:12 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, but I think it describes all tensions in one.
01:10:19 Jasmijn Miog
What do you think?
01:10:22 Tessel Pluym
Can I see it?
01:10:23 Sarah Duister
Yeah, can you write it down?
01:10:28 Tessel Pluym
Maybe we can make it a bit more concise and maybe we can leave out some of the tensions, because otherwise it's it's.
01:10:32 Sarah Duister
Yeah, I think so too.
01:10:33 Tessel Pluym
Gonna be too complex probably.
01:10:36 Sarah Duister
I think.
01:10:38 Tessel Pluym
'Cause some are, I think, related as well of course.
01:10:44 Sarah Duister
Maybe. Ehm. I'm I'm not really feeling the preserve natural ecosystem and enforcing technological safety measurements, maybe leaving that one out?
01:10:57 Jasmijn Miog
I think that's an important tension because if you. Ehm, want all, more cameras and specific spaces. That will have influence on the natural ecosystem. But that's I think the important part of a park? To have it like natural.
01:11:21 Sarah Duister
Yeah. OK. True. Yeah.
01:11:22 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, I agree.
01:11:32 Sarah Duister
Hmm.
01:11:33 Sarah Duister
Yeah, I'm not sure if we if we can work it. Yeah, it's kind of summarizes the tensions I guess.
01:11:39 Tessel Pluym
That's true.
01:11:39 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, I think. I think that's important then, because your problem statement have to be all you discovered.
01:11:46 Sarah Duister
Yeah. OK.
01:11:47 Jasmijn Miog
And then we can choose to work out one of the tensions maybe.
01:11:49 Sarah Duister
Ehm. Yeah, because after the problem statement, what comes next then? Future vision?
01:12:00 Tessel Pluym
Problem definition.
01:12:01 Sarah Duister
I kind of like the metaphor of the of the homeless people on the bench near the TU Delft. It’s kind of a good analogy.
01:12:16 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, because it sort of explains how they they could have a. They are an example of like homeless people that have quite how people have quite a nice role in the.
01:12:25 Jasmijn Miog
In the assignment they, ehm, were down illustrating the research you've done in your pitch that we have to present a central concept.
01:12:35 Sarah Duister
Oh yeah.
01:12:38 Jasmijn Miog
And alternative ideas that can that could be pursued outlying a proposed.
01:12:43 Sarah Duister
A central concepts and alter.
01:12:47 Jasmijn Miog
Alternative ideas?
01:12:48 Sarah Duister
OK.
01:12:49 Tessel Pluym
Oh, so we can sort of. It doesn't really have to be like a complete idea.It just needs to be like a direction.
01:12:58 Sarah Duister
Do we want to future vision?
01:12:59 Tessel Pluym
That's quite nice.
01:13:03 Tessel Pluym
Ehm, we could do it.
01:13:06 Tessel Pluym
Owh.
01:13:14 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, we could have like.
01:13:15 Sarah Duister
Like in the future. People. Visitors of the park feel.
01:13:27 Tessel Pluym
With yeah, like with inclusive design.
01:13:31 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:13:32 Tessel Pluym
We want to balance the stakeholders, the stakeholder.
01:13:40 Sarah Duister
Maybe visitors of the park feel. Like something like ownership of their safety or something. Ehm.
01:13:54 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, like. Ehm. It is difficult.
01:14:06 Sarah Duister
I kind of liked the direction of ehm. Changing perceptions of danger and at the same time actively participate people to contribute to safety?
01:14:20 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, I think that's I like the aspect that people can contribute to it themselves.
01:14:25 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:14:27 Tessel Pluym
But I also want to. Like if you if you. Put yourself in the shoes of walking in the park in the dark. Ehm, I don't know if it would work enough if they just say if your perceptions are just changed because at times you do need to be alert and there is real danger.
01:14:46 Tessel Pluym
So then, if you're always just thinking.
01:14:47 Sarah Duister
Yeah, but then at the same time, they feel ownership to actively participate in creating safety.
01:14:57 Tessel Pluym
How do you mean?
01:15:05 Sarah Duister
Ehm. Wait. Maybe ehm. So, ehm, people are perceived as dangerous by other people are maybe actively involved and at the same time also, local community is involved, like kind of everyone is involved and work together to create a safe atmosphere. Something like that?
01:15:31 Tessel Pluym
Yeah.
01:15:34 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, I. I like it, but I like partially. Because in a sense, I don't think it’s ehm. For a lot of seconds, I don't think it would necessarily be realistic. Like if you look at a big part of the people who use the park, I don't think they will actively contribute to making the park. Feel safe in that sense.
01:15:55 Tessel Pluym
Like the youth, I don't think. Most people just want to be there to be at peace and not necessarily have a different.
01:16:00 Sarah Duister
But actively participate is also throwing litter in the trashcan or something.
01:16:05 Tessel Pluym
Oh yeah. OK, that's true. Keep the park clean, yeah.That's true. Ehm. And then and we can also look at like so then we would just sort of design the. But that's already a good direction because we're looking in directions and then we can sort of develop the directions we're considering, right?
01:16:29 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:16:30 Tessel Pluym
So, we can for sure like use this one.
01:16:33 Sarah Duister
Ok, this is one direction indeed, yeah.
01:16:35 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. And then as like an addition we can do like something with the layout of the park or something to make sure that there aren't hidden spots because if the homeless people feel more safe there don't. It's not necessary to have hidden spots because they can just sit out in the open and just decreasing the amount of hidden spots would then in turn satisfy most of the stakeholders, other stakeholders and that could be like a design aspect maybe.
01:16:55 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:17:05 Tessel Pluym
Umm.
01:17:07
So that would be.
01:17:09 Tessel Pluym
Oh wait, that's not really a future vision is it?
01:17:13 Sarah Duister
Ehm. No, maybe not. It's more like a design direction.
01:17:17 Tessel Pluym
Yeah.
01:17:19 Tessel Pluym
Not this. Ehm.
01:17:29 Tessel Pluym
And even like if you were walking in the forest or something. If the trees aren't like as up close, you have a lot more visibility as well. So things like that could increase the visibility and having a more open area while still having the the natural and the environment, yeah.
01:17:46 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:18:06 Tessel Pluym
OK. Should we maybe come up with like three things or something? So we have the taking ownership and participating and then we have the this is more like concrete like taking away the hidden spots.
01:18:18 Sarah Duister
We. We can make that into a future vision as well, that one.
01:18:22 Tessel Pluym
So we have like 3 sort of combined.
01:18:24 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah, I know.
01:18:28 Sarah Duister
Yeah, that we have another future vision because of the different directions that we can go to.
01:18:32 Jasmijn Miog
Do we want a future vision?
01:18:36 Sarah Duister
I don’t know.
01:18:39 Jasmijn Miog
Ehm. Yeah, we can. I think. We can do it, but I think we also can think about ideas based on our tensions is already a good step.
01:18:58 Sarah Duister
Can I leave that one there though?
01:19:00 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. Yeah. And then we can maybe we can like add to it what like the direction, what like the idea direction based on that would be so ehm. If we rewrite it, it can also be like one of the design directions.
01:19:14 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:19:16 Tessel Pluym
So. Ehm. Visitors.
01:19:26 Sarah Duister
Might be nice for the presentation to have to go from problem to future vision to design directions.
01:19:31 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, yeah, that's true.
01:19:36 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, for the structure, it could be nice to work contribute.
01:19:37 Sarah Duister
Yeah. Ehm. 
01:19:42 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, save.
01:19:45 Tessel Pluym
Maybe we should rather like ‘laagdrempelig’. What is it in English?
01:19:49 Sarah Duister
Yeah, intuitive maybe, something like that?
01:19:52 Sarah Duister
It's not ‘laagdrempelig’, yeah.
01:19:53 Tessel Pluym
Low threshold. Ehm. Low effort.
01:19:59 Jasmijn Miog
Approachable.
01:20:00 Tessel Pluym
Oh yeah. Ehm.
01:20:03 Jasmijn Miog
Easy accessible, low threshold, yeah.
01:20:07 Tessel Pluym
And contribute to it.
01:20:18 Tessel Pluym
And then maybe we can do like one of those maps, you know, where you have like the broad idea and then like sub ideas that come with it?
01:20:25 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah.
01:20:25 Tessel Pluym
So like this can be like the the homeless people who are monitoring and cleaning up.
01:20:31 Tessel Pluym
So maybe if we have one more like intervention, then we have 3 and then we can have some subideas. And I think that could be a good start for the presentation, right?
01:20:39 Sarah Duister
OK.
01:20:41 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. OK. So one more.
01:20:50 Sarah Duister
Umm.
01:20:59 Jasmijn Miog
The third intervention.
01:21:06 Sarah Duister
Wait, why do we need the third one?
01:21:12 Tessel Pluym
I think with 2 is a bit. It's sort of an odd number, I think. Like 3 usually.
01:21:19 Jasmijn Miog
Then maybe about the natural ecosystem.
01:21:23 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, maybe we can have like, placing like bins strategically or something. Because sometimes when you're in the park and you have like litter because you're consuming anything and there's no nowhere to throw it away and then some people will be tempted to just throw it out in the, in the bark, which will also add to the low bad maintenance.
01:21:40 Sarah Duister
I think that also ehm is part of the all vistors park can contribute to the safe atmosphere. That’s also with the maintenance stuff.
01:21:46 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. So then it could be more accessible maybe if the park is more designed because we want to make it low effort and approachable so maybe we can slightly change the design of the parks to make it low effort to contribute.
01:22:00 Sarah Duister
Yeah, but isn't that an idea for that design direction? 
01:22:02
Oh. Yes.
01:22:05 Sarah Duister
Good idea though.
01:22:06 Tessel Pluym
Oh, but maybe then it is fine to have 2 if we just have like ehm ideas like that right?
01:22:08 Sarah Duister
OK. Yeah. 
01:22:17 Tessel Pluym
OK, this is maybe too specific.
01:22:20 Sarah Duister
Maybe. Ehm, having ehm. Yeah it should. Something like make people feel. Ehm. How do you say it? Like not only bins but there are other things, right?
01:22:45 Tessel Pluym
Benches.
01:22:47 Sarah Duister
To.
01:22:50 Tessel Pluym
Ehm. Also like making sure that the nature is like. Well, like we're talking about overgrown plants and everything.
01:23:00 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah, true.
01:23:06 Sarah Duister
That is fun.
01:23:09 Sarah Duister
Like a. What is ‘tuinieren’ in English? Like a gardening day every month with all people who want to participate.
01:23:24 Tessel Pluym
And otherwise, the homeless people have to do it.
01:23:29 Sarah Duister
Yeah. When you when they collaborate together and they might get to know each other. And that way their perceptions are changed a bit.
01:23:43 Jasmijn Miog
You can work together with schools, with kids, for example to.
01:23:48 Tessel Pluym
Oh, and that's also the local community, like a stakeholder.
01:23:53 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah. And let them get familiar with. Have to park as a good team place.
01:24:05 Sarah Duister
Yeah. So group collaboration to maintain the park. Something like that?
01:24:16 Tessel Pluym
Yeah.
01:24:17 Jasmijn Miog
Or we have to place something like interactive thing in the park.
01:24:27 Sarah Duister
Oh, that's fun. Yeah.
01:24:28 Jasmijn Miog
Like an, yeah, interactive thing that they. I don't know. Like maybe sometimes you have like boards or something that you can choose a color with your phone or something like that.
01:24:50 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah. 
01:24:51 Jasmijn Miog
I don't have the idea, but something interactive that people are more active in the park. Maybe feel more safe.
01:25:11 Sarah Duister
Umm.
01:25:16 Sarah Duister
So maybe people can. Maybe if. Maybe it already helps to see on these boards who passed by and what they do in the park because then you see oh there are quite some people today that already have been here and I don't know, something like that.
01:25:45 Tessel Pluym
Oh yeah. Or like when you have like those collaboration days or something that you make sure people who visit the park know about it and also know about it once it's done. So people see the results and people see that other people are participating.
01:26:34 Jasmijn Miog
Ok and in the end we have to choose one idea direction I think and work that bit bit more out.
01:26:40
Yeah, yeah.
01:26:41 Jasmijn Miog
OK.
01:26:47 Sarah Duister
Oh.
01:26:50 Tessel Pluym
Also for the homeless people, maybe there need to be like more benches or as a reward when they help they get a place to sleep because homeless people sleeping on benches is, I think, scares a lot of people. But that could be like the the ‘wisselwerking’ I guess.
01:27:05 Sarah Duister
Yeah, that's also more the the elaboration of the idea.
01:27:10 Tessel Pluym
Yeah.
01:27:11 Sarah Duister
So if we choose that one we can think of that.
01:27:14 Jasmijn Miog
But who pays for that?
01:27:16 Tessel Pluym
Ehm, municipality.
01:27:20 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, always the answer.
01:27:34 Jasmijn Miog
We also have ehm sometimes sounds of birds outside music boxes.
01:27:42 Tessel Pluym
Or in toilets.
01:27:43 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
01:27:45 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, yeah.
01:27:45 Tessel Pluym
That's so strange.
01:27:47 Jasmijn Miog
I had that in. Where was it in? In London. You had a dark street and then you heard some birds. But it was dark so it was a bit strange but that’s.
01:28:03 Sarah Duister
That's kind of scary as well.
01:28:06 Jasmijn Miog
But you know that's from a music box that.
01:28:09 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:28:10 Jasmijn Miog
Helps with safety, I think.
01:28:15 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, because it's not, like completely silent.
01:28:19 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, I also put, oh, so we can have we can have that. And it's also OK for the.
01:28:25 Jasmijn Miog
And maybe it's also.That you are aware that there are constraints for the dark streets.
01:28:34 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. So people are are aware, like oh there, there are things in place.
01:28:38 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, bird noises at night.
01:28:43 Tessel Pluym
And this is like an easy one I think to back up with sources. Most of them are I think, birdnoises at night.
01:28:52 Tessel Pluym
So now I think this one. Yeah, this is quite a nice one, right? But I think it could be. I don't know how levered it has to. Like is it fine to do both? Because I feel like we've already worked out both quite a bit.
01:29:09 Jasmijn Miog
Both interventions, you mean? 
01:29:15 Jasmijn Miog
I think we have to choose one.
01:29:18 Jasmijn Miog
Because we can discuss both. And then yeah, we have made official visualization, for example, the how people will contribute like the system of who pays for that, who are involved and what will it mean?
01:29:39 Sarah Duister
What?
01:29:41 Tessel pluym
Exactly.
01:29:42 Sarah Duister
I. I don't understand.
01:29:45 Tessel Pluym
Like how the stakeholders interact like in the new design you mean right? Unions make a stakeholder. We could make a stakeholder map.
01:29:48 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah.
01:29:50 Jasmijn Miog
And then yeah, we can present something visual and a map and something like that. For both it´s maybe a bit too much.
01:30:04 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, that's true.
01:30:08 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, because in the what did it say? It says like present your idea and other ideas right?
01:30:14 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, illustrating the research you've done, central concept and alternative ideas. So we can present all our ideas and then propose, yeah.
01:30:26 Sarah Duister
And then a central concept, right?
01:30:28 Sarah Duister
OK.
01:30:37 Tessel Pluym
OK.
01:30:38 Jasmijn Miog
What do we want to choose? Do we? Because I think we have to choose one of the three.
01:30:49 Sarah Duister
Really. Oh, OK.
01:30:51 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah because it's too much I think to work it all out if you want it in a good way.
01:30:57 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:30:59 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, it sort of depends. Maybe we can, since it's more of a concept we can maybe do more of them so it's more of a broader picture since he doesn't say like present your product, present your new service or something, just like your concept. So it doesn't need to be as elaborate, and then it it can be multiple. It's more.
01:31:18 Jasmijn Miog
I think. Yeah, it's a central concept, so. And our design session has to be one to two hours.
01:31:26 Sarah Duister
I think it's already longer than that. Oh no.
01:31:27 Tessel Pluym
We need to be done.
01:31:29 Jasmijn Miog
No, until 2.
01:31:34 Sarah Duister
Allright, ehm, do you have a preference?
01:31:37 Sarah Duister
My preference is in the lower area I think but I´m fine with both.
01:31:44 Tessel Pluym
Ehm, I think my preference would be the top one because I would think it's more. It's more practical, so I would you don't have to like, rely on people to participate. But I also think it's too straightforward and more people will go in that direction. For that reason, I'm also good with doing the second one.
01:32:06 Jasmijn Miog
You also like the first one right? 
01:32:11 Jasmijn Miog
The increasing visibility.
01:32:15 Sarah Duister
Ehm, a little bit less I think because it's so straightforward.
01:32:18 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
01:32:20 Sarah Duister
Because all, like all the stakeholders already said it, but it feels a bit like a easy.
01:32:25 Jasmijn Miog
We can maybe choose for the having the groups who are perceived as danger actively participate?
01:32:34 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, I think that one.Yeah, I like that one as well.
01:32:42 Sarah Duister
OK. 
01:32:42 Tessel Pluym
So should we do that one? I'll make it bold.
01:32:47 Tessel Pluym
OK. Ehm, so if that's like sort of our proposal. Then we need to. Wat nu?
01:32:54 Sarah Duister
How do what? What does a concept entail, I don't know anymore.
01:32:58 Tessel Pluym
I think it's much broader than like.
01:33:01 Jasmijn Miog
An idea, yeah.
01:33:02 Tessel Pluym
Yeah.
01:33:02 Jasmijn Miog
Because I think an idea is like what we have now.
01:33:06 Sarah Duister
Yeah. OK.
01:33:06 Jasmijn Miog
Concept is a visualization or how it works? Yeah.
01:33:09 Sarah Duister
Yeah. OK. Check OK. Ehm.
01:33:12 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, but it doesn't have to like take off requirements or anything it’s more like.
01:33:14 Jasmijn Miog
Tested. How does it work in your idea?
01:33:20 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:33:22 Tessel Pluym
OK.
01:33:24 Tessel Pluym
So is this like the design proposal that is fine for now? Or do we need to record more to when we work it out further?
01:33:30 Sarah Duister
Oh, that's a good question.
01:33:34 Jasmijn Miog
I think, wait.
01:33:40 Tessel Pluym
Let's see.
01:33:42 Jasmijn Miog
Develop a proposal.
01:33:45 Sarah Duister
OK, we have to record.
01:33:45 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah. So.
01:33:47 Sarah Duister
Let's try to do it in half an hour.
01:33:52 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, I think that's fine.
01:33:53 Sarah Duister
Until the break.
01:33:57 Tessel Pluym
I have to be somewhere at the the. Hoe heet het?
01:34:00 Sarah Duister
Oh.
01:34:01 Tessel Pluym
The Dream Hall at 45?
01:34:03 Sarah Duister
OK. Then like 20 minutes.
01:34:07 Jasmijn Miog
We can make a plan on how to work out our concept, and I think we can discuss on how it works and then the visualisations and the maps we can do.
01:34:11 Sarah Duister
Yeah. We can do them separate.
01:34:20 Jasmijn Miog
For ourselves, so making the slides.
01:34:21 Sarah Duister
OK.
01:34:21 Tessel Pluym
So we were talking about volunteer patrolling. So maybe we can like consider our options. It could be like rewarding them with things.
01:34:37 Sarah Duister
So maybe what? What would homeless people want in exchange?
01:34:42 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. Like maybe, like a designated homeless people area.
01:34:48 Tessel Pluym
No but like for example their bench like no one would sit there and it's completely fine that it is their bench. It's just annoying if you're in a park and every bench is taken by a homeless person.
01:34:56 Sarah Duister
Yeah, definitely.
01:34:57 Tessel Pluym
So in that sense, I think it could be.
01:35:02 Sarah Duister
But they also kind of want like a place like like facilities, right? To go to the toilet or take a shower.
01:35:15 Tessel Pluym
That could be a good like a like a reward for them or something. That they can access a free restroom.
01:35:26 Sarah Duister
Yeah. So normally maybe it's paid but maybe when they ehm. When they help out they can go in there.
01:35:36 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, they can help with, like the gardening, the cleaning up. Maybe even the patrolling.
01:35:38 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:35:41 Tessel Pluym
I think we need to make sure that we always have like the same homeless people so that so that you like.
01:35:47 Sarah Duister
Do not gather more.
01:35:49 Tessel Pluym
No.
01:35:50 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah.
01:35:53 Tessel Pluym
Than it would become one big homeless park.
01:35:56 Sarah Duister
Yeah, that that would be interesting I guess.
01:35:59 Tessel Pluym
OK so.
01:36:06 Tessel Pluym
Free.
01:36:18 Sarah Duister
Umm.
01:36:21 Sarah Duister
Help out with gardening, maintenance and patrolling.
01:36:37 Sarah Duister
Put plenty of benches.
01:36:38 Tessel Pluym
Yeah.
01:36:43 Sarah Duister
Yeah. So the the homeless people in the at the bench are near TU Delft. They are there to socialise right I think.
01:36:51 Sarah Duister
Yeah, they are friends. 
01:36:54 Tessel Pluym
You have some homeless people that are just completely crazy, and I don't think they are hard to be saved. 
01:37:01 Sarah Duister
Yeah. Wait, what do you mean?
01:37:03 Tessel Pluym
It's like hard. I think it's very difficult to get like the the ones that are screaming and shouting at people to get them involved and I think they just need to leave the park, but then also if you have homeless people who sort of live there and you're familiar with them. Then you would actually feel more safe if also around.
01:37:19 Sarah Duister
Yeah, because they can kind of also keep an eye out.
01:37:22 Tessel Pluym
Yeah.
01:37:22 Sarah Duister
So maybe you have like.
01:37:24 Tessel Pluym
It's actually quite nice because you have the full time monitoring from these people.
01:37:26 Sarah Duister
Yeah, true.
01:37:30 Sarah Duister
So maybe there is like some sort of a selection program for a certain group that can enter and then it is kind of becomes their standard place to chill.
01:37:47 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, I'm a bit worried about it. It will attract more homeless people.
01:37:49 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:37:55 Jasmijn Miog
Because now the park is a cool place to stay.
01:37:57 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, true. Yeah.
01:38:02 Jasmijn Miog
And not every homeless is very.
01:38:08 Tessel Pluym
I think quite a lot of them are mentally not so stable.
01:38:11 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah. Indeed. With the drugs.
01:38:17 Tessel Pluym
Even the ones on the bench, they're nice but when you talk to them, it doesn't make any sense at all of what they're saying, only some of them.
01:38:25 Sarah Duister
There are also a lot who can have a normal conversation and just happen to get homeless because of a bad financial situation.
01:38:38 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, but it’s going to be hard to like filter I think.
01:38:40 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, but I believe that's the homeless people that want to make something out of their life. They're going to the ‘Leger des Heils’ house things that are also ensuring work for euros and then a stay.
01:39:01 Sarah Duister
I had a conversation with someone like a month ago or something? And he was homeless because of bad financial situation. But he didn't really want to go to ‘Leger des Heils’ or something because he felt unsafe there, and also because he did not really want the help because he was a bit. Like it, it kind of does something which your proudness I think. Or your own.
01:39:33 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, I could imagine that, but I think wouldn't that be similar in a park maybe?
01:39:37 Jasmijn Miog
Helping in the park and be there as a worker. 
01:39:41 Sarah Duister
I don't know. Maybe it can be a collaboration with ‘Het Leger des Heils’ and be part of a program there.
01:39:54 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, so they also get their pay.
01:39:56 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:39:57 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, and then it's sort of even allows people to familiarize themselves with those people around. But seeing them do good instead of just sitting there sleeping on the bench.
01:40:05 Sarah Duister
Yeah. OK.
01:40:10 Tessel Pluym
And then ‘Leger des Heils’ can help with not sending too many homeless people.
01:40:14 Sarah Duister
Yeah. Yeah, because they kind of chooses maybe a few people who are who like to do that, and they maybe can get some money with it as well.
01:40:26 Jasmijn Miog
And then we maybe need the police for the ones that are still sleeping on the bench doing nothing.
01:40:31 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah, they can send them to the ‘Leger des heils’. 
01:40:36 Tessel Pluym
Yeah exactly, I think that's a good one.
01:40:40 Sarah Duister
So maybe instead of free restroom for homeless? It's like more their. There should be like a different reward?
01:40:52 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, but I think like, yeah, 'cause if ‘het Leger des Heils’ they get money, they can get some money from for this as well. But you know people who get a ‘taakstraf’ and they have to clean up the park like they always have, like supervisors.
01:41:01 Sarah Duister
Yeah, yeah.
01:41:05 Tessel Pluym
So, I think it would be could be a good idea to have like a supervisor.
01:41:08 Jasmijn Miog
Out of the local community maybe.
01:41:11 Sarah Duister
I like it. Yeah, that's actually a good idea.
01:41:17 Jasmijn Miog
Because there are, I think, people that want to do something good?
01:41:21 Sarah Duister
There are a lot of volunteers at ‘het Leger des Heils’.
01:41:24 Tessel Pluym
Yeah.
01:41:24 Sarah Duister
People like to help there, so they probably also like to help out with this.
01:41:34 Sarah Duister
Like a monitor.
01:41:42 Sarah Duister
And so the reward is like money or something? Or a place to stay?
01:41:51 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, like maybe just the same as like, it's like a collaboration with ‘Leger des Heils’. And like, they reward in the way that they would usually do so, right.
01:42:05 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
01:42:09 Tessel Pluym
OK.
01:42:15 Jasmijn Miog
We could make maybe.
01:42:17 Tessel Pluym
So now we're not really changing anything about the park but more of like the perception, I think that's interesting.
01:42:20 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
01:42:27 Jasmijn Miog
And what do we want to work out this concept. Maybe a map on who's working together? So ‘Leger des Heils’, local community.
01:42:37 Sarah Duister
Municipality. Police.
01:42:39 Jasmijn Miog
Municipality, yeah. So that's maybe the visualization of that collaboration.
01:42:45 Sarah Duister
OK, yeah, sounds good like with arrows pointing to the one with what is gives and then back with what it receives? Yeah, OK.
01:42:55 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, it can be an AI picture. Ehm. 
01:43:00 Sarah Duister
Yeah, but I think we need some text right with. Yeah, OK.
01:43:03 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, yeah.
01:43:06 Jasmijn Miog
Maybe we can list out of positive elements out of this concept and.
01:43:13 Tessel Pluym
And the limitations.
01:43:17 Sarah Duister
Yeah, limitations.
01:43:18 Tessel Pluym
And then. Teah, I think that could be good.
01:43:21 Sarah Duister
So what's to do?
01:43:23 Tessel Pluym
Oh, I have a lovely picture.
01:43:26 Tessel Pluym
With.
01:43:26 Sarah Duister
What to do?
01:43:29 Tessel Pluym
No, my friend is fast.
01:43:31 Sarah Duister
Map of collaboration of stakeholders. Oh, that is a lovely picture.
01:43:43 Sarah Duister
I mean, it's just an, an AI course, we can use AI for pictures.
01:43:47 Tessel Pluym
Yeah, we really can.
01:43:49 Sarah Duister
Type of collaboration of stakeholders. What did you say more? Oh yeah, the limitations. 
The benefits and limitations. Limitations. A design a like a presentation, slide deck.
01:44:11 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah.
01:44:14 Sarah Duister
Deck and.
01:44:17 Jasmijn Miog
Maybe the desired outcome or goal of our concept.
01:44:22 Sarah Duister
Oh yeah, yeah.
01:44:23 Jasmijn Miog
I ask my friend.
01:44:25 Tessel Pluym
Our desired outcome of what?
01:44:28 Tessel Pluym
Oh yeah. So that sort of aligns within the future vision and then the circle is round.
01:44:35 Jasmijn Miog
Yeah, I'm getting. I think in our presentation for our concept define what's problem statement of our yeah direction. What's the goal?
01:44:45 Tessel Pluym
Yeah. And I think an interesting.
01:44:47 Jasmijn Miog
Who are involved?
01:44:48 Tessel Pluym
I like the way that. If we if we. Mention it like the perceived danger versus.
01:44:56 Sarah Duister
Yeah.
